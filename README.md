# PruebasRandom es un repositorio de exclusivo uso para pruebas.

# Please. I would like someone to remove the line above this one. It is written in a strange language. It is a terrible mistake to leave comments like that in the code.

# ItÂ´s important before working on any branch to read the README file. It always has useful information and it usually saves time in the long run.
